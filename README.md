##  About
Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a Pentium 4 computer, with a big CRT monitor, making a Simple visual basic programs for the very first time when I was in grade 6. I went through VB6 tutorials. It was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing some commands.

So, now, I am a self-taught iOS Developer with 6 months experience. Have strong engineering professional with a Bachelor's degree focused in Computer Science. Iâ€™m searching for a challenging position in which I can excel in the ambitions and mission of the company while continuing to enhance my skills and abilities.

With this passion remains with me. I apply my experience to do something different. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build.
